I like the idea of building in public, sharing with the world what I'm working on. But actually doing it? That's hard.  
I don’t find it natural. I’d rather give a short talk or chat at a meetup.

So I’ve avoided it. And I want to change that!

# What this website is (and isn’t)

I don't want to post weekly threads or twenty pages essays. I just want to start writing. Nothing big, no pressure. Short thoughts, occasional notes, things I’d say out loud if we were talking in person.

That’s the goal: **write more, share more, but keep it simple.**
